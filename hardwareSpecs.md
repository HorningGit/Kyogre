## **UTRONICS Raspberry Pi Cluser Case**
"The fully complete case with compact design reserved enough space for 4 RPis, 4 2.5‚Äù SSDs, and an Ethernet switch, as well as 2 cooling fans." I chose this case as it supports Power over Ethernet hats on the Raspberry Pis, as well as a location for the Cisco switch I'll use for managed communications.
